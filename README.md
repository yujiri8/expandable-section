Component for vertical expand/collapse sections based on [Lit-Element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org) with no other dependencies.

Functions like the iron-collapse from the Polymer elements: it's controlled with a boolean `opened` HTML attribute and can start out either open or closed. It doesn't include a control because it's meant for when you want it controlled by an external button. When closed, it's entirely invisible, unlike [weightless](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weightless)'s wl-expansion.
